Clinton was projected by nearly every national public opinion poll as the heavy favorite going into Tuesday\\u2019s race. Instead, Republican Donald Trump won the election, shocking many throughout the nation and prompting widespread protests. Clinton has kept a low profile since her defeat after delivering her concession speech on Wednesday morning.  Clinton told her supporters on Saturday that her team had drafted a memo that looked at the changing opinion polls leading up to the election and that the letter from Comey proved to be a turning point. She said Comey\\u2019s decision to go public with the renewed examination of her email server had caused an erosion of support in the upper Midwest, according to three people familiar with the call. Clinton lost in Wisconsin, the first time since 1984 that the state favored the Republican candidate in a presidential election. Although the final result in Michigan has still not been tallied, it is leaning Republican, in a state that last favored the Republican nominee in 1988. Comey sent a letter to Congress only days before the election announcing that he was reinstating an investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information when she used a private email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2012.  Comey announced a week later that he had reviewed emails and continued to believe she should not be prosecuted, but the political damage was already done. Clinton told donors that Trump was able to seize on both of Comey\\u2019s announcements and use them to attack her, according to two participants on the call. While the second letter cleared her of wrongdoing, Clinton said that it reinforced to Trump\\u2019s supporters that the system was rigged in her favor and motivated them to mobilize on Election Day. The memo prepared by Clinton\\u2019s campaign, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said voters who decided which candidate to support in the last week were more likely to support Trump than Clinton. \\u201cIn the end, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome,\\u201d the memo concludes. A spokesperson for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment. On the phone call, Dennis Chang, who served as Clinton\\u2019s finance chair, said her campaign and the national party had raised more than $900 million from more than 3 million individual donors, according to the two participants who spoke to Reuters. As Clinton gave her account to donors, Trump hunkered down at Trump Tower with members of the transition team announced on Friday and tasked with selecting the 15 Cabinet posts and thousands of political appointment jobs. Kellyanne Conway, who served as his campaign manager, said on Saturday that the an announcement of a new chief of staff is \\u201cimminent.\\u201d Two candidates whose names have surfaced as contenders for the top White House job are campaign CEO Steve Bannon and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Trump will deliver a speech about his plans moving forward in the coming days and may undertake a national victory tour, Conway said, without providing further details. He will be sworn in on January 20. The president-elect plans to keep his communication channels open. In an interview with CBS\\u2019 \\u201c60 Minutes\\u201d that will air on Sunday, Trump said he isn\\u2019t ready to give up his Twitter account, where he routinely posted controversial statements during the campaign that unleashed harsh criticism.  \\u201cI\\u2019m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I\\u2019m going to be very restrained,\\u201d Trump said.  \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Lawmakers from Zimbabwe s main opposition party MDC will hold a meeting on Tuesday to decide whether to join their ruling party rivals to impeach 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe, the minority chief whip said. Although Mugabe s ZANU-PF has the required two-thirds  membership to remove Mugabe, participation by the opposition could give a boost to a process that was started by the military s intervention last week. \",\n          \"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump has added a veteran Washington lawyer to the team representing him in the investigations of possible collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia, including the criminal probe being led by special counsel Robert Mueller. John Dowd, who has represented key figures in a variety white-collar criminal matters and investigations, has joined the president\\u2019s defense team led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the team, said on Friday. Another well-known white-collar Washington lawyer will likely join the team shortly, according to a person familiar with the matter. Dowd, 76, represented U.S. Senator John McCain on congressional ethics charges in the \\u201cKeating Five\\u201d banking scandal in the late 1980s and early 1990s. McCain was cleared in the matter. In 1989, Dowd\\u2019s investigation on behalf of Major League Baseball led to former Hall of Famer Pete Rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Dowd also defended Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in a 2011 trial brought by federal prosecutors in New York over insider trading. Rajaratnam was found guilty and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Earlier in his career, Dowd served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was part of a U.S. Department of Justice organized crime unit. He went into private practice in 1978. He worked for many years at the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, retiring in 2015. Along with Kasowitz and Dowd, the other lawyers on Trump\\u2019s team so far are Jay Sekulow, a conservative activist with a radio call-in show, and Michael Bowe, a longtime partner in Kasowitz\\u2019s firm.  Mueller is investigating possible ties between Trump\\u2019s campaign and the Russian government, which U.S. officials have said meddled in the 2016 election. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. The special counsel also is looking into whether Trump has sought to obstruct the investigation, a person familiar with the inquiry said on Thursday. Former FBI Director James Comey testified earlier this month that Trump asked him to drop the bureau\\u2019s investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees are also investigating possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

credited with driving parts of the trump policy agenda  with mixed results  bannon was a top trump administration critic of the international paris climate agreement  along with scott pruitt  the head of the environmental protection agency  they helped persuade trump to announce in june that the united states would withdraw from the pact struck in  by nearly  countries  trump s daughter ivanka and son in law jared kushner  who were not fans of bannon  wanted washington to stay in the pact  bannon also opposed government support of green energy  which he called  madness  and a carbon tax on fossil fuels  bannon was a driving force behind trump s travel ban  it   barred u s  entry by people from several muslim majority countries  the ban was announced by trump  but poorly implemented  it immediately caused nationwide protests and confusion and was challenged in the courts  where it is still tied up  making it so far a partial win for bannon  bannon opposed an april military strike ordered by trump against a syrian air base in response to what the trump administration and u s  allies say was a poison gas attack by syria s military in which scores of civilians  including many children  died  trump has since touted his decision to carry out the strike as a bold one in contrast to former president barack obama  in line with bannon s position  trump initially threatened to scrap the north american free trade agreement  but then the president backtracked and said he was willing to renegotiate the trade pact with canada and mexico  bannon has long been skeptical of international alliances  trump alarmed u s  allies on the campaign trail by calling the nato security alliance  obsolete  and berating washington s western allies for not paying enough for their defense  after massive pressure from the pragmatist wing of trump s national security council  trump eventually underscored u s  commitment to article   a crucial part of the nato treaty  the mutual defense doctrine  the white house has been mired in a months long debate over a strategy for south asia  including afghanistan  one of the divisions was between bannon  who favored a withdrawal of u s  troops from washington s longest foreign conflict  versus national security adviser h r  mcmaster and most of the military brass who support a modest troop increase  trump met with his national security team on friday to try to reach agreement on a strategy for afghanistan  but made no decision on whether he would commit more troops  bannon has been a china hawk  urging a tougher line on trade toward beijing and dismissive of efforts to get china s help in reining in north korea  in an interview with the american prospect magazine published on wednesday  bannon said the united states was in an economic war with china and ridiculed suggestions of a military solution to the north korea issue  bannon supported a  border adjustment tax   part of a tax reform package drawn up by senior republicans in the house of representatives  the bat was meant to encourage exports  discourage imports and raise tax revenue  but it divided the business community because it would have raised consumer prices  house republicans recently dropped the bat from their proposal  a defeat for bannon  although he was not a central player in tax policy  bannon also pushed for tax cuts for the middle class  still not yet delivered   a major  trump campaign promise was to build a wall on the mexican border  a position supported by bannon  trump s vow that mexico would pay for the wall  which the mexican government has insisted it will not do  has strained relations between the two neighbors  work on the wall has not begun  \",\n          \" reuters    the following is the full text of the speech delivered on thursday by former massachusetts governor and  republican nominee for u s  president mitt romney to the institute of politics at the university of utah  i am not here to announce my candidacy for office   i am not going to endorse a candidate today  instead  i would like to offer my perspective on the nominating process of my party  in   days before the presidential election which  incidentally  we lost  ronald reagan went on national television and challenged america saying that it was a  time for choosing   he saw two paths for america  one that embraced conservative principles dedicated to lifting people out of poverty and helping create opportunity for all  and the other  an oppressive government that would lead america down a darker  less free path  i m no ronald reagan and this is a different moment but i believe with all my heart and soul that we face another time for choosing  one that will have profound consequences for the republican party and more importantly  for the country  i say this in part because of my conviction that america is poised to lead the world for another century  our technology engines  our innovation dynamic  and the ambition and skill of our people will propel our economy and raise our standard of living  america will remain as it is today  the envy of the world  warren buffett was   right when he said last week that  the babies being born in america today are the luckiest crop in history   that doesn t mean we don t have real problems and serious challenges  at home  poverty persists and wages are stagnant  the horrific massacres of paris and san bernardino  the nuclear ambitions of the iranian mullahs  the aggressions of putin  the growing assertiveness of china and the nuclear tests of north korea confirm that we live in troubled and dangerous times  but if we make the right choices  america s future will be even better than our past and better than our present  on the other hand  if we make improvident choices  the bright horizon i foresee will never materialize  let me put it plainly  if we republicans choose donald trump as our nominee  the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished  let me explain why  first  the economy  if donald trump s plans were ever implemented  the country would sink into a prolonged recession  a few examples  his proposed   tariff like penalties would instigate a trade war that would raise prices for consumers  kill export jobs  and lead entrepreneurs and businesses to flee america  his tax plan  in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt  so even as donald trump has offered very few specific economic plans  what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for american workers and for american families  but wait  you say  isn t he a huge business success that knows what he s talking about  no he isn t  his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them  he inherited his business  he didn t create it  and what ever happened to trump airlines  how about trump university  and then there s trump magazine and trump vodka and trump steaks  and trump mortgage  a business genius he is not  now not every policy donald trump has floated is bad  he wants to repeal and replace obamacare  he wants to bring jobs home from china and japan  but his prescriptions to do these things are flimsy at best   at the last debate  all he could remember about his healthcare plan was to remove insurance boundaries between states  successfully bringing jobs home requires serious policy and reforms that make america the place businesses want to plant and grow  you can t punish business into doing the things you want  frankly  the only serious policy proposals that deal with the broad range of national challenges we confront  come today from ted cruz  marco rubio  and john kasich  one of these men should be our nominee   i know that some people want the race to be over  they look at history and say a trend like mr  trump s isn t going to be stopped  perhaps  but the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign  if the other candidates can find common ground  i believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism  given the current delegate selection process  this means that i would vote for marco rubio in florida  for john kasich in ohio  and for ted cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating mr  trump in a given state  let me turn to national security and the safety of our homes and loved ones  trump s bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies  insulting all muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in the urgent fight against isis  and for what purpose  muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country  what he said on   minutes  about syria and isis has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the campaign season  let isis take out assad  he said  and then we can pick up the remnants  think about that  let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over a country  this is recklessness in the extreme  donald trump tells us that he is very  very smart  i m afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very  very not smart  i am far from the first to conclude that donald trump lacks the temperament of be president   after all  this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter  who attributed a reporter s questions to her menstrual cycle  who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance  who bragged about his marital affairs  and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity  donald trump says he admires vladimir putin  while has called george w  bush a liar  that is a twisted example of evil trumping good  there is dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits during the vietnam war while john mccain  whom he has mocked  was imprisoned and tortured  dishonesty is trump s hallmark  he claimed that he had spoken clearly and boldly against going into iraq  wrong  he spoke in favor of invading iraq  he said he saw thousands of muslims in new jersey celebrating    wrong  he saw no such thing   he imagined it  his is not the temperament of a stable  thoughtful leader  his imagination must not be married to real power  the president of the united states has long been the leader of the free world  the president and yes the nominees of the country s great parties help define america to billions of people  all of them bear the responsibility of being an example for our children and grandchildren  think of donald trump s personal qualities  the bullying  the greed  the showing off  the misogyny  the absurd third grade theatrics  we have long referred to him as  the donald   he is the only person in america to whom we have added an article before his name  it wasn t because he had attributes we admired  now imagine your children and your grandchildren acting the way he does   will you welcome that   haven t we seen before what happens when people in prominent positions fail the basic responsibility of honorable conduct   we have  and it always injures our families and our country  watch how he responds to my speech today  will he talk about our policy differences or will he attack me with every imaginable low road insult  this may tell you what you need to know about his temperament  his stability  and his suitability to be president  trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself  but polls are also saying that he will lose to hillary clinton    on hillary clinton s watch at the state department  america s interests were diminished in every corner of the world  she compromised our national secrets  dissembled to the families of the slain  and jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power   for the last three decades  the clintons have lived at the intersection of money and politics  trading their political influence to enrich their personal finances  they embody the term  crony capitalism   it disgusts the american people and causes them to lose faith in our political process   a person so untrustworthy and dishonest as hillary clinton must not become president  but a trump nomination enables her victory   the audio and video of the infamous tapper trump exchange on the ku klux klan will play a hundred thousand times on cable and who knows how many million times on social media   there are a number of people who claim that mr  trump is a con man  a fake  there is indeed evidence of that  mr  trump has changed his positions not just over the years  but over the course of the campaign  and on the ku klux klan  daily for three days in a row  we will only really know if he is the real deal or a phony if he releases his tax returns and the tape of his interview with the new york times  i predict that there are more bombshells in his tax returns  i predict that he doesn t give much if anything to the disabled and to our veterans  i predict that he told the new york times that his immigration talk is just that  talk  and i predict that despite his promise to do so  first made over a year ago  he will never ever release his tax returns  never   not the returns under audit  not even the returns that are no longer being audited  he has too much to hide  nor will he authorize the times to release the tapes  if i m right  you will have all the proof you need to know that donald trump is a phony  attacking me as he surely will won t prove him any less of a phony  it s entirely in his hands to prove me wrong  all he has to do is to release his back taxes like he promised he would  and let us hear what he said behind closed doors to the new york times  ronald reagan used to quote a scottish philosopher who predicted that democracies and civilizations couldn t last more than about  years  john adams wrote this   remember  democracy never lasts long  it soon wastes  exhausts  and murders itself  there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide   i believe that america has proven these dire predictions wrong for two reasons  first  we have been blessed with great presidents  with giants among us  men of character  integrity and selflessness have led our nation from its very beginning  none were perfect  each surely made mistakes  but in every case  they acted out of the desire to do what was right for america and for freedom  the second reason is because we are blessed with a great people  people who at every critical moment of choosing have put the interests of the country above their own   these two things are related  our presidents time and again have called on us to rise to the occasion  john f  kennedy asked us to consider what we could do for our country  lincoln drew upon the better angels of our nature to save the union   i understand the anger americans feel today  in the past  our presidents have channeled that anger  and forged it into resolve  into endurance and high purpose  and into the will to defeat the enemies of freedom  our anger was transformed into energy directed for good   mr  trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes  he creates scapegoats of muslims and mexican immigrants  he calls for the use of torture and for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists   he cheers assaults on protesters  he applauds the prospect of twisting the constitution to limit first amendment freedom of the press  this is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss  here s what i know  donald trump is a phony  a fraud  his promises are as worthless as a degree from trump university  he s playing the american public for suckers  he gets a free ride to the white house and all we get is a lousy hat  his domestic policies would lead to recession  his foreign policies would make america and the world less safe  he has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president  and his personal qualities would mean that america would cease to be a shining city on a hill   america has greatness ahead  this is a time for choosing  god bless us to choose a nominee who will make that vision a reality   \",\n          \"washington  reuters
